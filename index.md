- A platform that analyzes people's needs in digital privacy and security, and recommends them apps, extensions and pieces of software that will help them realize that goal.
- Meant to be a vague and opinionated collection of tools that either I have been using, or found interesting, as a collection of tools to serve the cause of digital privacy and security.
- Many thanks to [Awesome Privacy](https://github.com/lissy93/awesome-privacy/) for already doing most of the work for me. I came up with this idea individually, but then when I checked if someone else had the idea (they must've went my intuition), I found the repository, and borrowed a bit.

## An explanation of the thought process and the tools

General principles:

- For the average person, a VPN, a password manager, and an ad/cookie blocker and a tracker blocking service should be more than enough.
- For a security nerd who uses Kali or TailsOS and shows off to everyone their proton email, I have no answer, they probably know better than to look for "security tools" online.

## What do words mean?

**Free** is not always great. Sometimes, free apps are truly great and worth using, other times, you might end up in even less private a situation than before. This goes for proxies, VPNs, and almost anything. Most free options here are things you can trust.

**Open source** means the actual code behind the software is available for anyone to see. This means that the software is more trustworthy, and that it is more likely to be secure. This is because anyone can see the code, and if there is a security flaw, anyone can point it out. This also allows for self-hosting some apps, if you're truly tech savvy.

**Tiered** means that there are multiple tiers of the app, and the free tier is limited in some way. This is usually the case with email providers, and VPNs.

## Consider donating to the developers of these apps.

Privacy and security are not (should be) free, and the developers of these apps are doing a great service to the world. Consider donating to them if you can.
